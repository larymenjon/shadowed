🦇 Shadowed

Shadowed is a strategy-driven platform game developed in Unity, where the player is trapped inside a dark and mysterious castle inhabited by vampires. Survival depends on careful movement, timing, and decision-making.

🎮 Game Overview

The game begins inside the castle, placing the player immediately into danger. With no clear escape in sight, the player must explore the environment, avoid enemies, and find a way out before being caught.
The castle hides more threats than expected, and every mistake can be fatal.
